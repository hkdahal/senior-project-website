            <p><strong><i>Constellation Brands</i></strong> (CBrands) innovation department wants to positively disrupt the alcoholic beverage industry by leveraging emerging technologies, namely, Augmented Reality (AR). Competitors, such as 19 Crimes, captured the attention of the market using this technology. The goal of the Augmented Reality Experience Project team (InterstellAR) is to improve CBrands consumersâ€™ visibility and interactivity with on and off premise retailers. This will be achieved by creating an iOS PokemonGO-esque mobile application. End users will engage with their smartphone camera to see and interact with AR objects found in specific locations.
            </p>
            <p>The CBrands sales team stands to benefit from having the ability to rapidly test brand marketing displays through the use of AR images. Salespersons and distributors could then interact with the displays, testing effectiveness as well as seeing how a display would look in a given space at no actual resource cost.</p>
            <p>Brand marketers will use a web application to create and place AR objects, toggle interactivity in selected geolocations, view consumer metrics, and manage targeted campaigns. Interactions with AR objects will reward consumers with in-app points, and possibly even in-app currency to redeem towards purchasing CBrands products.
            </p>
            <p>
                The software team, InterstellAR, will reach these milestones through an iterative Scrum methodology. This will produce a minimum viable product (MVP) that is on-time for internal prototype testing and your use at the final presentation.
